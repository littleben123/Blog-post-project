## Installation
This project was carried out using Python 3 in the Anacnoda environment. 
Packages used are:
1) Pandas
2) Numpy 
3) Matplotlib.pyplot
4) Seaborn
5) sklearn.linear_model
6) sklearn.model_selection
7) sklearn.metrics
## Motivation
This project contributes the Nanodegree of Data Science from Udacity. The goal is to understand the factors affecting the price of AirBnB in Seattle and to develop models to predict the price. 
Three key business questions were answered: 
1) What is the price distribution of AirBnB in Seattle? 
2) What factors affect the price of AirBnB? 
3) How to predict the price?
## Repository Contents
The Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis following the CRISP-DM process.
## Process involved
The process starts with the three key buiness questions as stated above. To answer the questions, data gathering and data cleanning were first carried out. Then data visualization, data analysis and data modeling were carried out to assess the data in detail.
## Results
Code can be checked on [Github](https://github.com/littleben123/Blog-post-project/blob/master/Seattle_airbnb_project.ipynb).
A writeup of the analysis was posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@yinyy911125/reasonable-price-for-sleeping-well-in-sleepless-seattle-52272a5ce3bd). 
## Ackowledgements
The author thanks Udacity for providing this fun data analysis experience and Kaggle and AirBnB for providing the dataset.
